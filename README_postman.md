## üõ† Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/postman-clone.git
   cd postman-clone
   npm install

   ```

2. **Set up Firebase**
   ‚Ä¢ Create a Firebase project
   ‚Ä¢ Enable Google Sign-In under Auth > Sign-in method
   ‚Ä¢ Get your config keys and paste into .env.local:

3. Enable Google Drive API
   ‚Ä¢ Go to Google Cloud Console
   ‚Ä¢ Enable Drive API
   ‚Ä¢ Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web App)
   ‚Ä¢ Whitelist origin: http://localhost:3000

4. Run locally

   ```
   npm run dev

   ```

5. **üîÑ Syncing to Google Drive**

   - Users sign in via Google

   - All API collections are stored locally (IndexedDB)

   - Clicking ‚ÄúSync to Drive‚Äù uploads collections.json to a private Drive folder

   - Drive token is securely handled via Firebase Google auth

   - Only the user can access their files

6. **üß† Privacy First Philosophy**

   - All data stays in the user‚Äôs browser or Google Drive

   - We store no backend data

   - Built for developers who care about data ownership and speed

## üß† Prompt: Postman Clone with Local + Google Drive Hybrid Sync

I‚Äôm building a privacy-first Postman-like API testing app using Next.js and Firebase Auth.

‚úÖ The goal is to let users manage their API collections and requests without storing data on our servers. Instead, all data should remain under the user‚Äôs control.

Here‚Äôs the architecture vision:

üß© Core Design

1. Local-First Storage:
   ‚Ä¢ User data (collections, environments, requests) is stored locally in the browser, using IndexedDB (preferred over localStorage for structured JSON).
   ‚Ä¢ This allows instant access, offline support, and zero network delay.

2. Cloud Sync with Google Drive:
   ‚Ä¢ Users can manually sync their data to their own Google Drive via OAuth.
   ‚Ä¢ Data is stored in the user‚Äôs Drive either:
   ‚Ä¢ As a single collections.json file, or
   ‚Ä¢ As separate files per collection inside a dedicated folder (optional).
   ‚Ä¢ The sync can be one-click, on interval, or triggered on changes.

3. Authentication:
   ‚Ä¢ We‚Äôre using Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In to authenticate users.
   ‚Ä¢ Post-authentication, we extract the Google OAuth token to access the Drive API.

4. Sync Workflow:
   ‚Ä¢ On ‚ÄúSync to Drive‚Äù, we:
   ‚Ä¢ Fetch user data from IndexedDB
   ‚Ä¢ Serialize it as JSON
   ‚Ä¢ Upload/update the file(s) using the Google Drive API
   ‚Ä¢ We also support a lastSyncedAt timestamp to prevent conflicts.

5. Privacy by Design:
   ‚Ä¢ The entire app avoids storing any user data on our own backend.
   ‚Ä¢ All data lives in the user‚Äôs browser and their Google Drive account.

6. Future Enhancements:
   ‚Ä¢ Let users configure automatic sync intervals
   ‚Ä¢ Add UI status indicators: ‚úÖ Synced | üîÅ Syncing | ‚ö†Ô∏è Conflict
   ‚Ä¢ Version history using Drive‚Äôs built-in file revisions
   ‚Ä¢ Optional Google Sheets logging for sent request history

üéØ Overall Goal:

A secure, self-owned API tool that behaves like Postman, but stores everything in the user‚Äôs environment ‚Äî fast, private, and serverless.
